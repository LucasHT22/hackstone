# About
Welcome to Hackstone, a “You Ship, We Ship” project by Hack Club, where teenagers worldwide contribute to a unique and evolving online card game! This project provides an awesome hands-on opportunity to dive into Godot 4.0 development, creating custom cards that showcase individual creativity and technical skills.

# Engagement model

In this game, every card has a distinct personality and powers, brought to life by animations, graphics, sound effects, and mechanics—all designed and implemented by YOU, the community! Here’s your chance to build something cool, learn Godot, and get into game development by crafting a card that feels uniquely yours and sharing it with the community.  Upon landing a pull request that contains your card implementation, and only if you are a teenager, you will be eligible for a grant!!! (***NOTE - details of grant TBD***)
